                We first analyze the employee data distribution for all 3 companies. We noticed that over 60% of data collected from the current employees at McKinsey, BCG, and Bain are from Wharton Business School, Harvard Business School, and Kellogg School of Management. Wharton Business School takes the lead with over 1900 business school graduates.

                <br>
                <p class="body-p">As we go through the pie charts, among the current employees working at MBB, we can see the number of graduates working at McKinsey is much higher than Bain and BCG in each school. It seems very reasonable because the total number of employees is different. According to Wikipedia, McKinsey has approximately 27000 employees; BCG has approximately 21,000 employees, and Bain has approximately 10500 employees. 	
                </p>
                <p class="body-p">
                    When it comes to the individual school, we think they have a similar distribution in three companies. Some schools have different proportions, but none of those are significantly different.

            <br>
            <p class="body-p">According to our data, McKinsey possesses nearly 3,500 employees from top-tier business schools; BCG has nearly 2,500; Bain has around 2,000. As we can notice, Mckinsey and BCG have nearly 2-3 times the total number of employees compared to Bain, which is consistent with the fact.
            </p>
            <p class="body-p">
                By comparing the proportion of employees in each company for each school, we think they are relatively stable. We did not find any evidence that a particular company likes to hire graduates from one of the schools(Ex. Company A likes to hire graduates from school C much more than company B). We can also notice that Wharton business school, Harvard business school, and Kellogg School of Management perform much better compared to other schools in this chart.

                To better understand the flow and employment distribution we have used the Sankey diagram above. The width of each bar is proportional to the number of employees from that company or the number of graduates from that school. Please feel free to explore the diagram to see the exact number.
