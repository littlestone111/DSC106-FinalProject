                According to the parliament chart above, over 60% of data collected from the current employees at McKinsey, BCG, and Bain are from Wharton Business School, Harvard Business School, and Kellogg School of Management. Where Wharton Business School takes the lead with over 1900 business school graduates. It is very interesting to see the dataset is distributed in this way. Graduates from those schools probably have a higher chance to secure a position in those 3 companies.

                <p class="body-p">As we go through the pie charts, we can see the number of graduates working at McKinsey is much higher than Bain and BCG in each school. It seems very reasonable. According to Wikipedia, McKinsey has approximately 27000 employees; BCG has approximately 21,000 employees, and Bain has approximately 10500 employees. On the other hand, we can tell that some school graduates may have different preferences for those consulting firms.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="body-p">From the stacked bar chart above, we noticed that McKinsey possesses nearly 3,500 employees from top-tier business schools; BCG has nearly 2,500; Bain has around 2,000. Compare to the total number of employees for each school. As we can know, Mckinsey and BCG have nearly 2-3 times the total number of employees compare to Bain. We donâ€™t think either of them has too many advantages in recruiting those graduates from those top-tier business schools.

            <p class="body-p">
                Generally speaking, Wharton Business School, Harvard Business School, and Kellogg School of Management contribute the most.

                To better understand the flow and employment distribution we have used the Sankey diagram above. The width of each bar is proportional to the number of employees from that company or the number of graduates from that school. Please feel free to move around the diagram to see the exact number.
